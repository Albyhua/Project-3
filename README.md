# PartyMaster

## Description
This fork represents ongoing additional work done by Lucy Gouvin. This work is building off a group project, called PartyMaster, originally created as the final project for a Full Stack Development bootcamp.

PartyMaster is a dynamic MERN Stack single-page application, designed to streamline party planning and coordination. This platform simplifies the party organization process by eliminating the need for multiple communication channels like group chats and social media. Here's how PartyMaster stands out:

1. Centralized Event Management: PartyMaster allows users to create and manage events in one place. Users can invite others via email to join the app where they can RSVP, discuss event details, and coordinate contributions for potluck-style gatherings.
2. User-Friendly Dashboard: Upon account creation, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard. This dashboard neatly displays all events they're hosting or attending, providing a clear overview of their social calendar.
3. Advanced Frontend Technology: The front end of PartyMaster is built using React, offering a responsive and intuitive user interface. React's component-based architecture ensures a smooth user experience.
4. Efficient Data Handling: At its core, PartyMaster utilizes a GraphQL API, managed by a robust Node.js and Express.js server. This setup allows for efficient data operations like fetching, adding, updating, and removing information, ensuring real-time updates and seamless data management.
5. Reliable Database Structure: MongoDB, coupled with the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling), forms the backbone of PartyMaster's database. This combination offers flexibility and scalability, making it ideal for handling complex data structures needed for event management.
6. Secure User Authentication: Security is a top priority for PartyMaster. It incorporates JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication, ensuring secure access and protecting user data.

PartyMaster is more than just an event planning tool; it's a comprehensive platform that brings simplicity, efficiency, and security to the forefront of social event management.
